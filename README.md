# Staticalize

The framework agnostic static site generator.

Every language has its own static site generator, and every static site generator is made obsolete by the next static site generator that comes along to replace it every few years. Staticalize lets you hop off that hamster wheel.

It does this by providing a _general_ mechanism to convert any dynamically generated website into a static one. It doesn't care _what_ framework you use to generate your content so long as it is served over HTTP and has a [sitemap][sitemap]. It will analyze your sitemap and generate a static website for it in the output directory of your choice. All you need to provide is url of the server you want to staticalize and the base url of your production server.

For example, if you have the sourcecode of the frontside.com website running on port `8000`, you can build a static version of the website fit to serve on `frontside.com` into the `dist/` directory with the following command:


```ts
$ staticalize --site https://localhost:8000 --base-url http://frontside.com --outdir dist
```

This will read `https://localhost:800/sitemap.xml` and download the entire website to the `dist/` directory in a format that can be served from a simple file server running at `frontside.com`.
